MARLIN

CORAL
Mmm.
MARLIN
Wow.
CORAL
Mmm-hmm.
MARLIN
Wow.
CORAL
Yes, Marlin. No, i see it. It's beautiful.
MARLIN
So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think that we we're gonna
get the whole ocean, did you? Huh? [sighs] Oh yeah. a fish can breath out here. Did your
man deliver or did he deliver?
__Scene__1
CORAL
My man delivered.
MARLIN
And it wasn't so easy.
CORAL
Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.
MARLIN
You better believe they did--every single one of them.
CORAL
Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome.
MARLIN
So, you do like it, don't you?
CORAL
No, no. i do, i do. i really do like it. But Marlin, i know that the drop off is desirable
with the great schools and the amazing view and all, but do we really need so much space?
MARLIN
Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look,
look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! See, right by
their bedroom window.
CORAL
Shhh, you're gonna wake the kids.
MARLIN
Oh, right. Right.
CORAL
Aww, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.
MARLIN
You wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then
this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done.
CORAL
i like Nemo.
MARLIN
Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but i'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.
CORAL
Just think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents!
MARLIN
Yeah. What if they don't like me?
CORAL
Marlin.
MARLIN
No, really.
CORAL
There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one of them is bound to like you.
CORAL
What?
MARLIN
You remember how we met?
CORAL
Well, i try not to.
MARLIN
Well, i remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'
CORAL
Marlin!
MARLIN
'Well, you gotta look a little closer because it's wiggling'.
__Scene__2
CORAL
Get away!
MARLIN
Here he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go?
MARLIN
[gasps] Coral, get inside the house, Coral. No, Coral, don't. They'll be fine. Just get
inside, you, right now.
MARLIN
No!
MARLIN
Coral! Coral?
MARLIN
Coral? Oh!
MARLIN
Ohh. There, there, there. It's okay, daddy's here. Daddy's got you. i promise, i will
never let anything happen to you...Nemo.
NEMO
First day of school! First day of school! Wake up, wake up! c'mon, first day of school!
MARLIN

NEMO
Not you, dad. Me!
MARLIN
Okay...huh?
NEMO

NEMO
Oh boy--whoa!
MARLIN
Nemo!
NEMO
First day of school!
MARLIN
[gasps] Nemo, don't move! Don't move! You'll never get out of there yourself. i'll do it.
All right, where's the break? You feel a break?
NEMO
No.
MARLIN
Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids?
NEMO
No.
MARLIN
Are you woozy?
NEMO
No.
MARLIN
How many stripes do i have?
__Scene__3
NEMO
i'm fine.
MARLIN
Answer the stripe question!
NEMO
Three.
MARLIN
No! See, something's wrong with you. i have one, two, three--that's all i have? Oh,
you're okay. How's the lucky fin?
NEMO
Lucky.
MARLIN
Let's see.
MARLIN
Are you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.
NEMO
Come on, dad. It's time for school.
MARLIN
Ah-ah-ah! Forgot to brush.
NEMO
Ohh...
MARLIN
Do you want this anemone to sting you?
NEMO
Yes.
MARLIN
Brush.
NEMO
Okay, i'm done.
MARLIN
You missed a spot.
NEMO
Where?
MARLIN
There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here!
MARLIN
All right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get
some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?
NEMO
It's not safe.
MARLIN
That's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in.
And then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes,
if you wanna do it four times--
NEMO
Dad..
MARLIN
All right. Come on, boy.
NEMO
Dad, maybe while i'm at school, i'll see a shark!
MARLIN
i highly doubt that.
__Scene__4
NEMO
Have you ever met a shark?
MARLIN
No, and i don't plan to.
NEMO
How old are sea turtles?
MARLIN
Sea turtles? i don't know.
NEMO
Sandy Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about
a hundred years old!
MARLIN
Well, you know what, if i ever meet a sea turtle, i'll ask him. After i'm done talking
to the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin,
hold my fin.
NEMO
Dad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?
MARLIN
Hey, that snail was about to charge. Hmm, i wonder where we're supposed to go.
FISH KIDS
Bye, mom!
FISH MOM
i'll pick you up after school.
CRAB KID
Come on, you guys. Stop it! Give it back!
MARLIN
Come on, we'll try over there.
MARLIN
Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?
BOB
Well, look who's out of the anemone.
MARLIN
Yes. Shocking, i know.
BOB
Marty, right?
MARLIN
Marlin.
BOB
Bob.
TED
Ted.
BILL
Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Hey, tell us a joke.
BOB,TED
Yeah, yeah. Come on, give us a funny one.
MARLIN
Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any
other fish.
BILL
Aw, come on, clownie.
TED
Yeah, do something funny.
__Scene__5
BOB
Yeah!
MARLIN
All right, i   know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he
doesn't walk   up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place
and then the   sea cucumber, well they--i mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber.
None of them   were walking, so forget that i--
BOB
Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johansenn's yard, now!
KIDS
Whoa!
MRJOHANSSEN
All right, you kids! Ooh! Uuh, where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where, where'd you go?
NEMO
Dad, dad...can i go play too? Can i?
MARLIN
i would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.
MARLIN
That's where i would play
PEARL
What's wrong with his fin?
TAD
He looks funny!
SHELDON
Ow! Hey, what'd i do? What'd i do?
BOB
Be nice. It's his first time at school.
MARLIN
He was born with it, kids. We call it his lucky fin.
NEMO
Dad.
PEARL
See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles but you can't really
tell.Especially when i twirl them like this.
SHELDON
i'm H2O-intolerant. [sneezes]
TAD
i'm obnoxious.
MRRAY
[singing] Oooh, let's name the zones, the zones, the zones. Let's name the zones of the
open sea.
KIDS
Mr. Ray!
SHELDON
Come on, Nemo.
MARLIN
Whoa, you better stay with me.
MRRAY
[singing]..mesopolagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic. All the rest are too deep for you and
me to see.
MRRAY
Huh, i wonder where my class has gone?
KIDS
We're under here!
__Scene__6
MRRAY
Oh, there you are. Climb aboard, explorers. [singing] Oh, knowledge exploring is oh so
lyrical, when you think thoughts that are empirical.
NEMO
Dad, you can go now.
MRRAY
Well, hello. Who is this?
NEMO
i'm Nemo.
MRRAY
Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.
NEMO
Okay.
MRRAY
You live in what kind of home?
NEMO
An anemo-none. a nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone--
MRRAY
Okay, okay, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers!
MARLIN
Just so you know, he's got a little fin. i find if he's having trouble swimming, let him
take a break. Ten, fifteen minutes.
NEMO
Dad, it's time for you to go now.
MRRAY
Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. Okay, class, optical orbits up front.
And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves...that means you, Jimmy.
JIMMY
Aw, man!
MRRAY
[singing]
MARLIN
Bye, Nemo!
NEMO
Bye, dad!
MARLIN
Bye, son! Be safe.
BOB
Hey, you're doing pretty well for a first timer.
MARLIN
Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you?
BILL
Yeah, i had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off.
MARLIN
They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you,
insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!?
BOB
Hey, Marty. Calm down.
MARLIN
Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy!
BOB
'Pony boy'?
__Scene__7
BILL
You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.
TED
Pity.
MRRAY
[singing] Oh, let's name the species, the species, the species. Let's name the species
that live in thesea.
NEMO
Whoa.
MRRAY
[singing] There's porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three! Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma, and some fish like you and me. Come
on, sing with me. Oh...!
MRRAY
Just the girls this time. [singing] Oh, seaweed is cool. Seaweed is fun. It makes it's food
with the rays of the sun...
MRRAY
Okay, the drop off. All right, kids, feel free to explore but stay close. [gasps]
Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather. An entire ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck.
There are as many protein pairs contained in this...
TAD
Come on, let's go.
MRRAY
Come on, sing with me! [singing] There's porifera, coelentera, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa,
ctenophora, bryozoas, three!
NEMO
Hey guys, wait up! Whoa.
TAD
Cool.
TAD
Saved your life!
PEARL
Aw, you guys made me ink.
NEMO
What's that?
TAD
i know what that is. Oh, oh! Sandy Plankton saw one. He called, he said it was called a...a
butt.
NEMO
Whoa.
PEARL
Wow. That's a pretty big butt.
SHELDON
Oh, look at me. i'm gonna go touch the butt. [sneezes] Whoa!
SHELDON
Oh yeah? Let's see you get closer.
PEARL
Okay. Beat that.
TAD
Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?
NEMO
Uh, my dad says it's not safe.
__Scene__8
MARLIN
Nemo, no!
NEMO
Dad?
MARLIN
You were about to swim into open water!
NEMO
No, i wasn't go out--but dad!
MARLIN
It was a good thing i was here. If i hadn't showed up, i don't know--
PEARL
Sir, he wasn't gonna go.
TAD
Yeah, he was too afraid.
NEMO
No, i wasn't.
MARLIN
This does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky i don't tell your parents you were out
there.
You know you can't swim well.
NEMO
i can swim fine, dad, okay?
MARLIN
No, it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, i was right. You'll start school
in a year or two.
NEMO
No, dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean--
MARLIN
Clearly, you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do
these
things but you just can't, Nemo!
NEMO
i hate you.
MRRAY
There's--nothing to see. Gather, uh, over there. Excuse me, is there anything i can do? i am a
scientist, sir. Is there any problem?
MARLIN
i'm sorry. i didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little
too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.
MRRAY
Well, i can assure you, he's quite safe with me.
MARLIN
Look, i'm sure he is. But you have a large class and he can get lost
from sight if you're not looking. i'm not saying you're not looking--
FISH KID
Oh my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea!
MARLIN
Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and i'll have to get
you before another fish does! Get back here! i said get back here, now! Stop! You take one
move, mister. Don't youdare! If you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me?
Don't touch the bo--Nemo!
TAD
[whispering] He touched the butt.
MARLIN
You paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man.
Do you hear me? Big...big--

DORY
a boat? Hey, i've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way, it went this
way. Follow me!
MARLIN
Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat

DORY

MARLIN
If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And i know funny..i'm a clownfish!
DORY
No, it's not. i know it's not. i'm so sorry. See, i suffer from short-term memory loss.
MARLIN
Short-term memory loss..i don't believe this!
DORY
No, it's true. i forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least i think
it does. Hmmm..where are they? Can i help you?
MARLIN
Something's wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. i have to find my son. [gasps]

BRUCE
Oh, come on, i insist.
MARLIN
o-okay..that's all that matters.
DORY

sea mollusk says to the cucumber...
NEMO

Root canal, eh? What did he use to open?
PEACH

GURGLE
The dentist took him off the reef.

i'm going to see a man about a wallaby.
BLOAT

NEMO

GURGLE
She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.
BUBBLES
Poor Chuckles.
DEB
He was her present last year.
BLOAT
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.
PEACH
She's a fish killer.
NEMO

MARLIN
It's gone. i've lost the mask.

MARLIN
You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son, now it's gone.
DORY
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills. When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do?
MARLIN

MARLIN
Duck!
DORY

MARLIN

MARLIN

MARLIN,DORY

JACQUES
Psst. Nemo.
NEMO
Mmmm...
JACQUES
Nemo.
NEMO
Huh?
JACQUES
Suivez-moi. Follow me.
BLOAT,BUBBLES,GURGLE
[chanting] Ha! Ho! Hwa! Hwee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ha! Ho! Hwa! Hwee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ha! Ho!
Hwa! Hwee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Hahoo! Wahoo! Yahoo! Ho! Ha! Ho! Wahee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Hoo!
GILL
State your name.
__Scene__23
NEMO
Nemo.
GILL
Brother Bloat, proceed.
BLOAT
Nemo! Newcomer of orange and white, you have been called forth to the summit of Mount
Wannahockaloogie to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.
NEMO
Huh?
PEACH
We want you in our club, kid.
NEMO
Really?
BLOAT
If you are able to swim through..THE RING OF FIRE! [whispers to Jacques] Turn on the
Ring of Fire! The Ring of Fire, you said you could do it--THE RING OF FIRE!
BUBBLES
Bubbles! Bubbles! Let me--oww!
BLOAT,BUBBLES,GURGLE
[chanting]
PEACH
Isn't there another way? He's just a boy!
JACQUES
[wailing]
GILL
From this moment on, you will now be known as Sharkbait.
BLOAT,BUBBLES,GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh ha ha!
GILL
Welcome, brother Sharkbait!
BLOAT,BUBBLES,GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh ha ha!
GILL
Enough with the Sharkbait.
GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh..ba-ba-doo.
GILL
Okay, Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed?
BLOAT,BUBBLES,GURGLE
Agreed!
GILL
We can't send him off to his death. Darla's coming in 5 days, so what are we gonna do?
i'll tell you what we're gonna do: we're gonna get him outta here. We're gonna help
him escape.
NEMO
Escape? Really?
GILL
We're all gonna escape!
GURGLE
Gill, please, not another one of your escape plans.
DEB
Sorry, but they, they just, they never work.
__Scene__24
BLOAT
Yeah. Why should this be any different?
GILL
'Cause we've got him.
NEMO
Me?
GILL
You see that filter?
NEMO
Yeah?
GILL
You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing. What we need you to do is take
a pebble inside and jam the gears. You do that and this tank's gonna get filthier and
filthier by the minute. Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank himself. And
when he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in the individual baggies, then we roll
ourselves down the counter, out of the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the
street and into the harbor! It's foolproof! Who's with me?
BLOAT
Aye!
JACQUES
Aye!
DEB
Aye!
BUBBLES
Aye!
GURGLE
i think your nuts.
GILL,NEMO
[sighs]
GURGLE
No offense, kid, but, um..you're not the best swimmer.
GILL
He's fine, he can do this. So Sharkbait, what do you think?
NEMO
Let's do it.
DORY
i'm going to p. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where are you going? i'm going to p.
Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. If you're askin' where i'm goin'. i'll tell you that's
where i'm going. It's p. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where? i'm sorry, i didn't hear
you. p. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way...
MARLIN
Excuse me. Ex-excuse me, um, hi. Do you know how to get to--hello? W-w-w-wait! Can you
tell me--hey! Hold it! Wait a minute! i'm trying to talk to you. Okay, fellas, come back
here. Please, one quick question. i need to aaaaand they're gone again. [sighs]
DORY

MARLIN
Okay, all right.
DORY
Huh?
MARLIN
Here's the thing.
DORY
Uh-huh.
__Scene__25
MARLIN

DORY
Okay.
MARLIN
y'know, alone.
DORY
Uh-huh.
MARLIN
Without, without..well, i mean, not without you. i mean, it's just that i don't want you...
with me.
DORY
Huh?
MARLIN
i don't wanna hurt your feelings..
DORY
You want me to leave?
MARLIN
Well, i mean not..yes, yeah. It's just that you know i-i just can't afford anymore delays
and you're one of those fish that cause delays. And sometimes it's a good thing. There's
a whole group of fish. They're..'delay fish'.
DORY
You mean..[whimper]you mean you don't..like me? [sobs]
MARLIN
No, of course i like you. It's because i like you i don't wanna be with you. It's a
complicated emotion. Oh, don't cry. i like you.
MOONFISH LEADER
Hey, you! Lady, is this guy botherin' you?
DORY
Um, i don't remember. Were you?
MARLIN
No, no, no, no, no. We're just, we're..hey, do you guys know how i can get to--
MOONFISH LEADER
Look, pal. We're talkin' to the lady, not you. Hey-hey, you like impressions?
DORY
Mm-mmm-mmmm.
MOONFISH LEADER
Okay. Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen. So, what are we? Take a guess.
DORY
Oh, oh, i've seen one of those.
MOONFISH LEADER
i'm a fish with a nose like a sword.
DORY
Wait, wait, um..
MARLIN
It's a swordfish.
MOONFISH LEADER
Hey, clown boy! Let the lady guess. Where's the butter?
DORY
Oh-oh-oh! It's on the tip of my tongue.
MARLIN
[coughs up answer]Lobster.
__Scene__26
MOONFISH LEADER

MARLIN

MOONFISH LEADER
Lots of legs, lives in the ocean.
DORY

DORY
Oh, they're good.
MARLIN

MOONFISH LEADER

DORY
Ha ha ha ha ha!
MARLIN

MOONFISH LEADER
Blah-blah-blah! Me-me-blah! Blah-blah-blah-blah-me-me-me!
MARLIN
Thank you.
DORY
Oh dear. Hey, hey come back! Hey, what's the matter?
MARLIN
What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions, i am miles from
home, with a fish that can't even remember her own name.
DORY
Boy, bet that's frustrating.
MARLIN
Yeah. Meanwhile my son is out there.
DORY
You're son Chico?
MARLIN
Nemo.
DORY
Right. Got it.
MARLIN
But it doesn't matter, 'cause no fish in this entire ocean is gonna help me.
DORY
Well, i'm helping you. Wait right here. Hey, guys.
MOONFISH LEADER
What, is he bothering you again?
DORY
No, no, he's a good guy. Go easy on him, he's lost his son, Fabio. Any of you heard of
p. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?
MOONFISH LEADER
Sydney? Oh sure. Why, Ted here's got relatives in Sydney. Don't you, Ted?
MOONFISH TED
Sure do.
__Scene__27
DORY
Oh, hey! They know Sydney!
MARLIN
[gasps]
DORY
You wouldn't know how to get there, would you?
MOONFISH LEADER
What you wanna do is follow the EAC, that's the East Australian Current. Big current,
can't miss it, it's in..that direction. And then you gotta follow that for about, i
don't know, what do you guys think? About three leagues? And that little baby's gonna
put you right past Sydney.
MOONFISH SCHOOL
TA-DAA!
MARLIN
Great! That's great! Dory, you did it!
DORY
Oh, please. i'm just your little helper. Helping along, that's me.
MARLIN
Well, listen fellas, thank you.
MOONFISH LEADER
Don't mention it. And, uh, loosen up. Okay, buddy?
DORY
Oh, you guys. You really nailed him. Bye.
MOONFISH LEADER
Oh, hey ma'am, one more thing.
DORY
Yes.
MOONFISH LEADER
When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.
DORY

Hold on. Wait! Wait-wait! i got, i gotta tell you something..whoa. Nice trench. Hello!
Okay, let's go.
MARLIN
Bad trench, bad trench. Come on, we're gonna swim over this thing.
DORY
Whoa, whoa, partner. Little red flag goin' up. Somethin's telling me we should swim through
it, not over it.
MARLIN
Are you even looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it.
DORY
i'm sorry, but i really, really, really think we should swim through.
MARLIN
And i'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go.
DORY
Come on, trust me on this.
MARLIN

Come here.
DORY
Ow, ow! Oww!
MARLIN
It doesn't look bad, you're gonna be fine. But now we know, don't we?
DORY
Yeah.
MARLIN

Nicely done! Can you hear me?

fan to stop it turning.
NEMO
Aaah!
GILL
Careful, Sharkbait.

Well, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me.
TURTLE KIDS
[gasp]
DORY
No way.
SQUIRT
What happened?
MARLIN
No, no, no, kids. i don't wanna talk about it.
TURTLE KIDS
Awww! Please?
SQUIRT
Pleeeease?
MARLIN
[sighs] Well, okay. i live on this reef, a long long way from here.
DORY
Oh, boy. This is gonna be good, i can tell.
MARLIN
And my son, Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it if i hadn't been
so tough on him, i don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when
he was out there, these divers appeared and i tried to stop them but the boat was too fast.
So we swam out in the ocean to follow them...
TURTLE KID
They couldn't stop them. And then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into..
SMALL FISH
..three ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowin' them up!
BIG FISH
Golly, that's amazing!
SMALL FISH
And then dives thousands of..
LOBSTER
..feet straight down into the dark. It's like wicked dark down there, you can see a thing.
How's it goin', Bob? And the only thing that they can see down there..
SWORDFISH
..is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man.
And then he has to blast his way...
DOLPHIN
So, these two little fish have been..searching the ocean for days. On the East Australian
Current.
FEMALE BIRD
Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney..
MALE BIRD 1
..Harbor in a matter of days. i mean, it sounds like this guy's gonna stop at..
__Scene__36
MALE BIRD 2
..nothing until he finds his son. i sure hope he makes it.

NEMO

GILL

NIGEL
Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean looking for you.
NEMO
My father? Really?
GILL
Really?
NIGEL
Oh yeah. He's travelled hundreds of miles. He's been battling sharks and jellyfish and
all sorts of--
NEMO
Sharks? That can't be him.
NIGEL
Are you sure? What was his name? Some sort of sportfish or something: tuna, uh, trout..
NEMO
Marlin?
NIGEL
That's it! Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef.
NEMO
It's my dad! He took on a shark!
NIGEL
i heard he took on three.
DEB,BLOAT,GURGLE
Three!?
GILL
Three sharks!?
BLOAT
That's gotta be forty eight hundred teeth!
NIGEL
You see, kid, after you were taken by diver Dan over there, your dad followed the boat
you were on like a maniac.
NEMO
Really?
NIGEL
He's swimming and he's swimming and he's giving it all he's got and then three gigantic
sharks capture him and he blows them up! And then dives thousands of feet and gets chased
by a monster with huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock and what does he get for a
reward? He gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest! And now he's riding with a bunch
of sea turtles on the East Australian Current and the word is he's headed this way right
now, to Sydney!

All righty, Mr. Smarty Pants.
DORY

MARLIN
Me. And the next one's just a guess: me.
DORY
Okay, that's just scary.
MARLIN
W-w-wait, i have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it
before and that means we're going in circles and that means we're not going straight!
DORY
Hey. Hey!
MARLIN
We gotta get to the surface, come on! Let's figure it out up there. Let's go! Follow me!
Wha--?
DORY
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Relax. Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask somebody for directions.
MARLIN
Oh, fine. Who do you wanna ask, the speck? There's nobody here!
DORY
Well, there has to be someone. It's the ocean, silly, we're not the only two in here.
Let's see...okay, no one there. Uhh, nope. Nada. [gasps] There's somebody. Hey! Excuse--
MARLIN
Dory! Dory! Dory! Okay, now it's my turn. i'm thinking of something dark and mysterious.
It's a fish we don't know. And if we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out
our bones!
DORY
What is it with men and asking for directions?
MARLIN
Look, i don't wanna play the gender card right now. You wanna play a card? Let's play the
'Let's Not Die' card.
DORY
You wanna get outta here, don't you?
MARLIN
Of course, i do.
DORY
Well then, how are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot and hope for the best? Hmmm?
Hmmmm!? Come on, trust me on this.
MARLIN

Excuse me! Woohoo! Little fella? Hello. Don't be rude, say 'hi'.

DORY
Maybe a different dialect. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOAAAAAAAAAA..!
MARLIN
Dory. Dory, this is not whale. You're speaking like..upset stomach.
DORY
Maybe i should try humpback.

MARLIN
It doesn't sound orca! It sounds like nothing i've ever heard!
DORY
MOOOO..MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
MARLIN
It's just as well, he might be hungry.
